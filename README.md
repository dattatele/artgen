ArtGen is a CLI tool that generates ASCII art from images and text. This project was created out of an interest in building something fun using existing Python packages. It is free, open-source, and designed to convert images into ASCII art. Additional features and changes are being explored and will be updated in upcoming versions.

## Features

Two New features
- **interactive web** mode to allow more control and support for local image upload
- **interactive cli** mode to allow run within terminal.

- Fetches images using DuckDuckGo
- Converts images to ASCII art
- Shows fallback stylized text with `pyfiglet`
